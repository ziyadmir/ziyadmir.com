            </div>

            <p>
                Now you're comfortable. At least being in the water and getting your ass kicked doesn't scare you anymore. You're just sitting there, getting thrown around, but you're used to it. You're not scared. You know you're going to be wet. You know you're going to be cold. You know your eyes are going to burn because water keeps getting in them. You know the waves don't stop coming—they don't care how tired you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                You know that you'll swallow a little water and get thrashed and your board will fly around, but you aren't bracing your body to try and take the impact anymore. You have accepted that the ocean is bigger than you. You've accepted that the ocean is more powerful than you. And now you're becoming comfortable in it.
            </p>

            <h2>The Accidental Discovery</h2>

            <p>
                You see the white water coming and realize that you're not going to be standing and surfing like you thought you would anytime soon. You realize all you need to think about right now is catching the wave.
            </p>

            <p>
                It happened accidentally when you were just fighting with the swell. You got caught in some wave, but magically you turned around and you were getting pushed by the wave. You hadn't felt that feeling before and you're like, "Oh, interesting—that's catching a wave."
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p class="text-sm mb-0">
                    <strong>That feeling:</strong> Your board somehow got pushed by the wave and you actually caught it. It took you in closer to the beach, but that was freaking awesome. That was so fun. You didn't realize that's what it would feel like.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Now you have a new goal. Your goal is just to do that over and over and over. So you keep going back out and you try to catch the wave—that's your only goal. It's hard because you don't know exactly how you should be planning for it.
            </p>

            <h2>The Simple Technique</h2>

            <p>
                The way to do this step is to realize that the object of the game, the purpose in this phase, is to just be able to catch a wave. Here's how:
            </p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How to Catch White Water:</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>Turn and face the beach</li>
                    <li>Look back a little bit behind you for the white water coming in</li>
                    <li>When the white water is 20 feet or 10 feet behind you, start paddling</li>
                    <li>Keep paddling—don't stop, don't try to stand, don't do anything else</li>
                    <li>Just keep paddling until the wave makes you stop</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
                You will feel it when the wave catches you. It will push you and you'll realize there's no point in paddling anymore because the wave has caught you and is pushing you forward. That's the goal in this step.
            </p>

            <h2>The Joy of White Water</h2>

            <p>
                It's a micro step, and it's basically called catching the wave in white water. All you need to do is face the beach, and when a wave comes in, you just paddle, paddle, paddle. You will catch it.
            </p>

            <p>
                You'll have so much fun just riding the wave like that. Just lying on your board, being pushed by the white water toward the beach. That feeling alone is worth all the struggle to get here.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p class="text-sm mb-0">
                    <strong>Remember:</strong> This is the next step. Don't rush to stand up. Don't worry about looking cool. Just master catching white water waves. The rest will come later.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="series-nav">
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    <strong>Next up:</strong> Once you've mastered catching white water consistently, you'll be ready to start popping up and finding your balance. But for now, just enjoy the ride.
