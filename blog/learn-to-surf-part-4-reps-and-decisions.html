            </div>

            <p>Today at Big River in Mendocino, I had a breakthrough. Not in technique—my popup is still ugly and my stance needs work. The breakthrough was simpler: I stopped caring what I looked like and started caring about how many waves I could catch.</p>

            <p>And for the first time, I stood up on wave after wave after wave.</p>

            <h2>The Rep Game</h2>

            <p>Here's what I noticed: most people in the water with me barely tried any waves. They'd paddle out, sit on their boards, look around nervously, let wave after wave pass by. "Should I go? What's that guy doing? Will I look stupid if I miss?"</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, I was going for everything that looked even remotely catchable. Did I eat it spectacularly on half of them? Absolutely. Did other surfers probably think I was a kook? Definitely. Did I care? Not even a little bit.</p>

            <p>Because here's the thing: every wave you attempt teaches you something. Every wipeout is data. Every successful ride, no matter how short or awkward, builds neural pathways. The person attempting 20 waves learns exponentially faster than the person attempting 3.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>The Math of Learning:</strong> If you attempt 20 waves and catch 5, you've had 5 successful experiences and 15 learning opportunities. If you attempt 3 perfect waves and catch 2, you've optimized for looking good but minimized your learning.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Split-Second Decision</h2>

            <p>Another pattern emerged today. When a big set rolled in, I noticed people hesitating. That pause—that moment of "should I?"—is usually enough to miss the opportunity entirely.</p>

            <p>My approach became simple: See wave. Quick assessment: Can I possibly make any part of this? If yes, paddle like hell. No hesitation, no second-guessing.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I'd realize mid-paddle that I was completely out of position. Sometimes the wave would close out before I could catch it. But sometimes—and this is the key—I'd catch something I never thought I could. Those unexpected successes taught me more about my capabilities than any perfectly planned wave ever could.</p>

            <h2>The Career Parallel</h2>

            <p>This isn't just about surfing. It's about how we approach anything new:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In startups:</strong> The founder who ships 10 imperfect features learns faster than the one perfecting their first</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In engineering:</strong> The developer who submits frequent PRs improves faster than the one polishing code in isolation</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In life:</strong> The person who asks for 100 opportunities gets more yeses than the one who waits for the perfect moment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The fear of looking foolish is the enemy of rapid improvement. Your reputation among strangers in the lineup matters exactly zero. Your skill progression matters everything.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <strong>Today's Results at Big River:</strong><br>
                Waves attempted: Lost count (probably 30+)<br>
                Waves caught: At least 10<br>
                Successful popups: 7-8<br>
                Times I looked ridiculous: Countless<br>
                Amount I improved: Immeasurable
            </div>

            <h2>The Last Wave Problem</h2>

            <p>Here's another crucial insight: when you see a good set coming and you hesitate for even a minute, it might be the last good set for 20 minutes. Or an hour. The ocean doesn't care about your preparation or your fear.</p>

            <p>Today, every time I saw something promising, I made an immediate decision and paddled hard. Even if I only caught part of the wave, even if my ride lasted 3 seconds, it was worth it. Because the alternative—sitting there watching others surf while you wait for perfection—teaches you nothing.</p>

            <h2>Embracing the Kook Life</h2>

            <p>I've decided to fully embrace being a kook. To go for waves I'm not ready for. To fall spectacularly in front of better surfers. To prioritize attempts over appearances.</p>

            <p>Because here's what I realized: every good surfer was once where I am now. The only difference between us is they've had more reps. And the fastest way to close that gap isn't to wait for perfect conditions or perfect form—it's to maximize attempts, embrace failure, and learn from every single wave.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The Volume Principle:</strong> In any skill acquisition, volume of attempts beats perfection of execution in the early stages. You can't optimize what you haven't tried. Get the reps in first, refine later.
            </div>

            <h2>The Joy of Not Caring</h2>

            <p>There's something liberating about not caring what others think. When you stop performing for an audience and start performing for your own growth, everything changes. The waves get easier to read because you're not distracted by ego. The popups get smoother because you're not tense with self-consciousness.</p>

            <p>Today at Big River, surrounded by better surfers, I had more fun than any previous session. Not because I surfed well—I didn't. But because I surfed often. I took every opportunity the ocean gave me, and a few it didn't.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow I'll go back and do it again. More waves, more wipeouts, more learning. Because the path to competence isn't paved with perfect attempts—it's built on a foundation of countless imperfect ones.</p>

            <p>Get your reps in. Everything else is just ego.</p>
