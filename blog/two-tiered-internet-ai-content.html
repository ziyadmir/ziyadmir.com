            <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-4">August 10, 2025</p>
            <p>While working on ad systems at YouTube, I saw search queries with virtually no relevant results. The audience was there; the content wasn’t. YouTube’s revenue wasn’t demand constrained—it was limited by supply.</p>

            <p>Generative AI is about to fill that gap on a massive scale. As automated tools pump out endless videos, articles, and posts, the open web will drown in machine-generated filler. Most of it will be optimized for clicks and ads rather than insight.</p>

            <h2>The Free, Ad-Supported Tier</h2>
            <p>In this world, the default experience will be cheap or free but overrun with algorithmic content. Ads keep the lights on, but genuine human creativity becomes harder to find. It’s like cable TV with hundreds of channels and nothing to watch.</p>

            <h2>The Paid, Human-Curated Tier</h2>
            <p>To escape the noise, more people will pay for walled gardens where real people create and moderate the content. Think of it as a premium internet—fewer ads, higher signal, and a direct line to authentic voices.</p>

            <p>We already see hints of this with subscription newsletters, paid communities, and platforms that verify human authorship. As AI floods the commons, those niches will grow into a second, parallel internet.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>The bifurcation won’t just change how we browse; it will reshape the business of content creation. Brands and creators will choose sides: volume in the free tier, or depth in the paid tier. Users will decide how much authenticity is worth.</p>

            <p>When I realized YouTube’s growth was limited by content supply, it was a glimpse of what the entire web will face. The next wave of AI-generated material will make that divide impossible to ignore.</p>
            <h2>The AI Quality Divide</h2>
            <p>It won't be siloed. Paid users get good AI, while the free tier gets "shit AI." One tier is useful and helps you learn; the other leaves your brain slightly less healthy. That's the more-versus-less divide.</p>
