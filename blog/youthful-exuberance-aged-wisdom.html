            <p>There's a fascinating dichotomy you start to notice as you move through life, a tension between the young and the old that plays out everywhere. It's the raw, unbridled energy of youth—exuberance, confidence, bravado, testosterone—pitted against the quiet strength of experience—thoughtfulness, patience, diligence, and wisdom. I see it in sports, in my career, and in the timeless stories of human nature.</p>

            <p>A friend of mine was just saying how everything is starting to click for him now, all thanks to a collection of "little tricks" he's picked up. He used to think losing a piece in chess was no big deal. Now he understands that these seemingly small actions have a massive impact on the final outcome. In soccer, I used to just play; now I'm constantly calculating—<em>do I have enough space to receive this pass? Can I make this move safely without risking a mistake?</em> It's the classic risk-reward calculation. As you get older, you naturally start to tune down your risk profile.</p>

            <p>You see the same arc in a career. At 22, you're bullheaded. You are 100% certain about the things you know to be true. Looking back, you realize how often you were wrong, but in the moment, that confidence is absolute. Now, in my mid-30s, I'm much more aware that I'm not always right. I've learned to modulate, to recognize the ghost of my own youthful overconfidence.</p>

            <p>But then there's the other side of it. In my professional life, I work with people who have 10 or 20 years more experience than I do. From the perspective of that 22-year-old, the young guy is a force of nature. Think of Ja Morant in the NBA—fearless, reckless, awe-inspiring. He'll attack the rim, dunk on anyone, jump over everything. He seems invincible. But that same bravado leads to injuries and poor decision-making. At the same time, that boldness, that intuitive and almost delusional confidence, is precisely what allows for incredible, game-changing plays. It's what makes them superstars.</p>

            <p>YC actively seeks out founders with that irrational exuberance because that's the drive that wills a company into existence. It's what pushes them to go the extra mile. So who's right? The brash young buck or the wise old veteran?</p>

            <p>Maybe neither. Maybe it's just the season of your life. When you're young, you might think, <em>"Maybe I need to tone it down, be more nuanced."</em> But is that really what you should be doing? Or is that just your time to be bold? From that same perspective, you look at the old guys and think they're slow, out of touch, and lazy. <em>"If it weren't for the hierarchy,"</em> you think, <em>"I'd run circles around them."</em></p>

            <p>This dynamic is universal, especially for men. Think of the ancient commander. He was once a warrior, and his leadership was forged in battle. To maintain control over his unit as he aged, he couldn't just rely on his rank. Every once in a while, he had to strip off his armor, get down in the dirt, and prove he could still fight. It wasn't about being the absolute best hand-to-hand combatant anymore. It was about the willingness to engage, to prove his competence, to earn the respect of his men. It showed he still had the skills.</p>

            <p>Life is an accumulation of these "tricks." In surfing, the young bucks might try to power through the waves. The older surfers, a bit slower, are more methodical. They read the water, looking for the channels where the waves aren't crashing. They take a small step left, ten steps forward, a little hop right—conserving energy, always conserving energy, until the perfect moment. It's the "old man game" you see in every sport: a more refined, polished, and safer style that has been developed out of necessity. They had to adapt, or they'd be out of the league.</p>

            <p>This parallel—between youthful fire and measured experience—is everywhere. It's a constant negotiation between risk and wisdom, and maybe the point isn't to decide which one is right, but to understand that each has its time and its purpose in the arc of a life.</p>
