My name is Ziyad Mir. My early childhood involved international moves before my family settled in Canada. My father pursued a career as a mechanical engineer, often with energy companies, while my mother, a trained biochemist, dedicated herself to raising our family before later returning to work in customer service. We eventually made our home in Port Elgin, ON.

Early Memories
I have some early memories from a time before we moved to Canada. I recall attending a school where a kind teacher would help me. School life from that period is a bit hazy, but I remember glimpses of activities like a talent show. We were quite young when we made the transition to Canada.

During that earlier period, my father worked for a company located near the coast. My mother was our first teacher, guiding my older brother and me through lessons in reading, writing, and math. Our days were often spent indoors learning, partly due to the warm climate. Evenings, however, were for play, and I have memories of running to nearby pools as the sun set, with the sea visible in the distance.

High School
In high school, I was actively involved in sports, with football (QB) and basketball (small forward) being my favorites. I also played rugby (fullback or wing) and soccer (right defense). I found my social footing in high school, though it felt somewhat surface-level initially as I had moved to Port Elgin just before high school started. It's a small town where many had grown up together, so I didn't share the same long-standing connections. On my first day of high school, I remember making a bold fashion choice with a pink collared shirt and sporting a thin mustache.

One vivid memory from 9th grade involves my gym teacher, Pete Buttenaar. On the first day, he seemed like a no-nonsense former athlete. On the second day, in the weight room, a large classmate claimed he could bench 200 lbs. Pete challenged him with a $100 bet, and to my surprise, Ronnie (the classmate) successfully lifted it. I was new to weightlifting and didn't fully grasp the significance then. A few weeks later, during our first football session in class, I, playing safety, made an interception on a deep pass. Pete, also the football coach, was impressed and encouraged me to try out for the team. I responded with a bit of youthful cockiness, and we shared a laugh. After that, I became part of the "cool kids" group, mostly athletes and their friends.

Another incident stands out: a confrontation with a student named Paul LaTouf in the main hall. He was about my size and build, and known for his aggressive demeanor. He started talking close to my face, and I didn't back down. When he tried to push me, I pushed back, resulting in a standstill. I think he was surprised by my strength. He never bothered me again, and neither did anyone else in high school after that.

University and Early Career
I attended the University of Waterloo starting in September 2009, studying Systems Design Engineering. This multidisciplinary program combined mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. A key part of the program was its co-op system, involving six four-month internships alternating with academic terms. My last three internships were in high-tech roles: as a software engineer at LinkedIn and Google, and then as an Associate Product Manager (APM) at Google.

There’s a humorous story about how I ended up at Waterloo. My older brother was very computer-savvy, while I often found computers frustrating. Heading into 12th grade, unsure about my future studies, I briefly considered marine biology after watching a movie. However, my brother chose to study computer engineering at Waterloo. I initially leaned towards McMaster University, thinking it offered a better social environment alongside strong academics. I applied to Waterloo for mechanical engineering nonetheless and received an early admission offer.

Relieved and somewhat expectant, I relaxed and focused on basketball. Later that summer, just weeks before starting university, I looked up the mechanical engineering program on Waterloo's website and was horrified to see it seemed heavily physics-based, a subject I disliked and struggled with. Panicked, I explored other engineering programs at Waterloo. "Systems Design Engineering" caught my eye, mainly because the name sounded appealing. I called the university to inquire about transferring. While waiting for their response, I researched the program and was drawn to its holistic, multidisciplinary approach. It felt like the right fit, even before I fully understood all the details – a "me" moment, as my friends later described it.

My journey with computers had a turning point. Frustrated with Windows, I decided to install Ubuntu on my Dell laptop, possibly at my brother's suggestion. I didn't understand partitioning or BIOS, but I managed to get it running. This experience was transformative. Linux felt simpler and cleaner, and I gradually became more comfortable. I started using the terminal, learning Unix utilities, Vim for editing, and g++ for compiling. Debugging through print statements and logs became familiar. For the first time, outside of gaming, I began to enjoy computers. This coincided with my older brother practicing coding problems for his Waterloo co-op interviews. I tried to emulate him, and though I found the problems difficult, my interest in computing grew.

There's another amusing anecdote about my first encounter with programming. In tenth grade, I took an optional programming class. The teacher was uninspiring, and the language taught was Pascal. The examples and projects seemed dull, so I did the bare minimum, creating a simple, buggy card game for my final project. It reflected my lack of genuine interest at the time, a pattern where I'd scrape by if not truly engaged. Coincidentally, this teacher was also a University of Waterloo graduate.

Quora
After graduating in May 2014, I joined Quora, a startup, where I worked for about a year and a half. It was an exciting but demanding period. I collaborated closely with the CEO, Adam D’Angelo, on investigating why Quora’s search traffic wasn’t growing proportionally with its content volume; in fact, traffic per piece of content seemed to be declining. We conducted a lengthy experiment (over six months) where we removed the signup wall from the first page view ("first click free"). Following this change, search traffic increased significantly. Our hypothesis was that the signup wall had been causing domain-level penalties from search engines due to high bounce rates from users encountering the wall immediately. However, proving this was challenging. Running experiments on a small traffic segment (e.g., 5%) would only show local engagement impacts, not broader domain-wide effects, which are determined by search engines over time. I believed that providing a good user experience was paramount – users dislike hitting a content wall after a search click.
