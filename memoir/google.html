            <p>
                After my time at Uber, I was ready for a new challenge. I'd experienced the intensity of early-stage startups at Opendoor and the scale-up challenges at Uber. Google represented something different—a chance to work at truly massive scale with some of the brightest minds in the industry.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Transition to Google</h2>
            
            <p>
                I joined Google in September 2017, initially as a Technical Lead/Manager for the Reporting and Insights team. The role involved taking over a team of just one person and growing it to six Software Engineers. This was my first formal management position, though I'd been in technical leadership roles before.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The transition to Google was fascinating. On one hand, I was impressed by the caliber of talent—everywhere you turned, you'd find people who were world-class in their domains. On the other hand, I had to adjust to Google's unique culture and decision-making processes, which were quite different from the startup world.
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote-block">
                At Google, I quickly learned that technical excellence alone wasn't enough. You needed to build consensus, navigate complex organizational structures, and communicate your ideas clearly to drive change.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Moving to YouTube</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, I transitioned to YouTube, focusing on the YouTube Select product. This was a pivotal moment in my career at Google. YouTube presented a unique set of challenges—it was operating like a startup within Google, but with all the resources and scale of a tech giant.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brand advertising at YouTube was undergoing a transformation, and I saw an opportunity to make a significant impact. I began working closely with cross-functional teams across YouTube Organic, YouTube Ad Serving, Premium Ads Experience, Google Ads Frontend, YouTube RevShare, Finance, and Global Sales.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those first few months at YouTube were a steep learning curve. I had to understand not just the technical landscape but also the complex business relationships and revenue models that powered YouTube's advertising ecosystem. I spent hours with product managers, engineers, and sales teams, trying to grasp the full picture.
            </p>
            
            <h2>YouTube Select: Growing the Brand Business</h2>
            
            <p>
                As I settled into my role, I became the technical lead for YouTube Select, the premium advertising solution for brand marketers. This was a $5B+ ARR business, and I was responsible for ensuring its technical foundation was solid.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the first major projects I led was improving the delivery and reporting systems for YouTube Select. The existing infrastructure was straining under the growing demand, and we needed a more scalable solution. I assembled a team of engineers and worked closely with product managers to redesign the system from the ground up.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This project taught me valuable lessons about leading at Google's scale. I had to balance technical considerations with business needs, manage competing priorities, and ensure alignment across multiple teams. It was challenging but incredibly rewarding to see the impact of our work on YouTube's business.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The YouTube Shorts Challenge</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 2021, as TikTok was rapidly gaining popularity, YouTube was investing heavily in its Shorts format. This presented a new challenge: how could we extend our brand advertising solutions to this new, fast-growing format?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I saw this as an opportunity to build something new from the ground up. I initiated and led the YouTube Select for Shorts project, bringing together a cross-functional team to develop a brand advertising solution specifically designed for short-form content.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This project was particularly challenging because we were competing directly with TikTok Pulse and Instagram Contextual Ads. We needed to create something that leveraged YouTube's unique strengths while delivering the performance that brand advertisers expected.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We launched YouTube Select for Shorts in 2022, and it quickly became a significant revenue driver, generating $XXXM in incremental ARR. This success was a testament to the team's hard work and our ability to innovate within Google's ecosystem.
            </p>
            
            <h2>YouTube Flash: A Game-Changer for Brand Identity</h2>
            
            <p>
                Building on the success of YouTube Select for Shorts, I embarked on my most ambitious project yet: YouTube Flash. This initiative aimed to revolutionize how brands connect with audiences by leveraging advanced ML models to identify emotionally resonant moments in videos.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The genesis of YouTube Flash came from a deep insight: while auction-based advertising was excellent for performance metrics, it struggled to build and reinforce brand identity. Brands needed a way to connect with audiences in moments that aligned with their values and identity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This project pushed the boundaries of what was possible with Google's machine learning capabilities. We worked closely with teams from Google DeepMind to implement multimodal models like Gemini and PaLI, which could understand video content at a deeper level than ever before.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The technical challenges were immense: processing millions of videos, developing sentiment graph taxonomies, creating efficient serving paths for high-throughput video metadata. But the results were equally impressive, generating significant new revenue and receiving enthusiastic feedback from brand partners.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Leadership Growth and Team Building</h2>
            
            <p>
                Throughout my time at Google, I've grown significantly as a leader. I've learned to balance technical depth with strategic thinking, to nurture talent and build high-performing teams, and to navigate complex organizational dynamics to drive innovation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of my proudest achievements has been mentoring engineers and helping them grow in their careers. Seeing team members I've coached take on bigger challenges and succeed has been incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've also had the opportunity to interview over 300 candidates, helping to shape Google's engineering organization. This experience has given me valuable insights into what makes a successful engineer at Google's scale.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            
            <p>
                As I continue my journey at Google, I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. The advertising landscape is constantly evolving, and there are still many untapped opportunities to innovate and create value.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm particularly interested in how emerging technologies like generative AI can transform advertising, making it more relevant, engaging, and effective for both brands and consumers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My time at Google has taught me that the most impactful innovations often happen at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and deep human insights. That's where I plan to focus my energy in the years ahead.
            </p>
