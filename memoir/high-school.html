            <p>
                In high school, I played a lot of sports, with football (quarterback) and basketball (small forward) being my favourites. I also played rugby (fullback or wing) and soccer (right defence). I was pretty popular in high school, but it was kinda at a shallow surface level. I think this is because I moved to Port Elgin right before high school started, and it's a small town where everyone grew up together, so I didn't have the same ties to everyone as the rest of the kids at my school.
            </p>
            
            <h2>First Impressions</h2>
            
            <p>
                My first day of high school, I was feeling bold and showed up with a pink collared shirt on. I had a thin little moustache as well. I remember one moment from 9th grade pretty vividly. On the first day of school I had gym class and my teacher, Pete Buttenaar did some random role call and admin stuff with us — I got the sense that he was a no nonsense hard nosed former athlete.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the second day of gym class we went to the weight room and a huge (probably 6'1, 210) kid in my class said to Pete that he could probably bench 200 lbs. Pete laughed and said I bet you $100 you can't. Ronnie was strong and did it right then, one rep of 200 lbs at around 13 years old — I was pretty shocked but didn't fully understand since I had never bench pressed anything like that and didn't know what it meant.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Finding My Place</h2>
            
            <p>
                A few weeks later, we were playing football for the first time in class. Nobody really knew who I was, other than a couple of the athletic kids who saw me in the summer before school. I remember playing safety and immediately picking the ball off on a deep ball in a jump ball between me and two of the wide receivers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pete was impressed and told me to come out for football next fall to play for his team (he was the football coach as well). I was cocky and said, "yeah maybe, let's see." Pete said, "let's see? What else are you going to be down?" and we both laughed. After that, I basically was part of the cool kids, who were mostly the athletic kids with a few of their party friends thrown in.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Testing Boundaries</h2>
            
            <p>
                One time in the main hall we were all chilling in between class or at lunch, and a kid named Paul LaTouf came up to me and we were talking. He was about my weight and height, about 5'11 and maybe 175 lbs, athletic looking. You know how some people just have that aggressiveness to them, that real dog in them? That was him — his older brother was a bigger, stronger, meaner version of him as well (later I learned that their dad was exactly the same, and was a police officer or lieutenant at the Nuclear power plant where my dad worked).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anyways, Paul just kept talking in my face and I didn't take intimidation from anyone. He reached out to push me with both hands on my biceps but I reacted right away and pushed him back — it was like a standstill in a tug of war and I think he was pretty shocked at how strong I was. He was a big, strong kid. But so was I, and it might have been the first time he'd ever come face to face with someone who could kick his ass just as likely as he could kick mine. He never tested me again, in fact nobody in high school ever did after that.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Athletics and Identity</h2>
            
            <p>
                Athletics became a core part of my identity during high school. On the football field as a quarterback, I developed leadership skills and learned how to perform under pressure. Basketball gave me an outlet for my competitive drive and taught me the value of teamwork and consistent practice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the winter, a few of my friends and I would go to Saint Joe Catholic school in Port Elgin, pretty much every day we would spend hours there and play game after game after game. Some of my funniest and most athletic moments have taken place there and in fact, I have a few pictures of me trying to dunk a volleyball in a basketball on that court. The room was a little tilted low, but I was still pretty athletic and could get above the rim.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is also the first time where I started having issues in my lower back, and I wonder if all of those jumps on the concrete without any training and no core strength slipped a disc early at 17.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
                Looking back at my high school years, I recognize how formative they were in shaping who I am today. While I found social acceptance through athletics, I was also developing strengths that would serve me well beyond high school—resilience, competitiveness, and the ability to quickly adapt to new environments. The confidence I gained during these years would help me navigate the much bigger transitions ahead as I prepared to enter university.
