            <p>
                Near the end of my time at Quora, I got a Facebook message from JD Ross, saying that he wanted to meet me in SF from a recommendation he got from Lucy Guo. I went up to SF to meet him, and it turned out he was a founder at a startup that was trying to do something different in real estate: they wanted to buy and sell houses as a company, and they wanted to digitize the home transaction process.
            </p>
            
            <h2>First Impressions</h2>
            
            <p>
                They showed me around the office, I talked to engineers and saw the internal tooling they had built to start automating the process, and I was basically sold. The environment was dynamic, energetic, and exciting. I wanted to be there.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before I signed the offer letter, JD and Eric Wu (the CEO) offered to take me out to somewhere in San Francisco for dinner. I didn't know where to go or what to eat, so I just randomly searched up something I thought wouldn't make me look like a 23-year-old idiot with no clue about good food. We went to La Briciola in San Francisco.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I can't remember anything we talked about, probably because it was a pretty chill night and we enjoyed some steaks and fine wine (at the time, and even now, I barely know anything about wine, but I'm sure they bought some good stuff). Eric intimidated me, as I always got this sense that when he looked at or talked to me, his mind was processing about 5 things about me all at the same time. It felt like he could read my internal thoughts at the same time I felt them. That was strange to me.
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote-block">
                Years later, and looking back, I think I can do that to some people, but I'm not sure if they can tell that I'm doing this in the same way that I felt that about Eric years ago.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Diving Into The Work</h2>
            
            <p>
                I joined the company — it's called Opendoor. Work was fun in a way it had never been before - on one of my first days (it may actually have been my first day), Daniel LaGrotta started pair programming with me to help me understand how to start making changes to their internal tool (we called it the admin tool). This was how Opendoor ran; there was a consumer side (beautiful website and landing page) where people could request offers, and then the process was encoded into workflows behind the scenes that operators at the company could manage using the admin tool.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Human-Computer Partnership</h2>
            
            <p>
                Mostly everything was done by the operations team. Manually, using the admin tool. I learned a few key lessons here that hadn't even crossed my mind earlier: that you could fake scale by having humans do the most difficult parts of the process that were hard to automate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was a revelation for me. In my previous roles, I had always been focused on full automation - the idea that technology should handle every aspect of a process. But at Opendoor, I saw a more nuanced approach: use technology to empower humans rather than replace them outright, especially in the early stages of disrupting an industry.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Building for Operations</h2>
            
            <p>
                I quickly realized that the most valuable software I could build wasn't directly for consumers, but for our operations team. Every efficiency gain in the admin tools multiplied across the organization. If I could save each operations person 10 minutes per day, across dozens of team members, that translated to massive productivity gains.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This approach meant getting extremely close to the operations teams—sitting with them, understanding their workflows, and identifying friction points. I'd often shadow someone for half a day, then immediately go back to my desk and implement changes to address what I had observed.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Business Model Insight</h2>
            
            <p>
                What fascinated me most about Opendoor was the business model innovation. The company wasn't just building better technology for real estate—it was fundamentally rethinking how homes could be bought and sold by becoming a market maker.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This required deep understanding across multiple domains:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Pricing algorithms to accurately value homes</li>
                <li>Operations workflows to inspect, repair, and maintain properties</li>
                <li>Consumer psychology to understand what would make people comfortable selling to a company</li>
                <li>Capital markets expertise to finance the home purchases</li>
                <li>Real estate market knowledge to understand geographic expansion</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                It was refreshing to work at a company where technology was just one piece of a larger puzzle. This multidisciplinary approach meant I was constantly learning from experts in fields far outside software engineering.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Learning from Leadership</h2>
            
            <p>
                The leadership team at Opendoor impressed me in ways I hadn't experienced before. Eric Wu, the CEO, had an incredible ability to be both detail-oriented and strategic—he could dive deep into the pricing models one minute and articulate a compelling vision for transforming real estate the next.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JD Ross, who had initially recruited me, had an uncanny ability to identify consumer pain points and translate them into product requirements. Ian Wong, the CTO, showed me how deep technical expertise could be applied to novel problems in an industry as traditional as real estate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Working closely with this caliber of leadership early in my career exposed me to different styles of thinking and problem-solving that I've carried with me since.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Scaling Operations Through Technology</h2>
            
            <p>
                One of my most valuable lessons from Opendoor was understanding how to build technology that scales operations. Rather than trying to automate everything at once, we focused on:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Identifying the highest-leverage parts of the process to automate first</li>
                <li>Creating tools that made human operators exponentially more efficient</li>
                <li>Collecting data from human decisions to eventually build more sophisticated algorithms</li>
                <li>Gradually increasing automation as we understood the edge cases better</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                This approach allowed the company to scale much faster than if we had tried to build fully automated systems from the beginning. It was a practical lesson in how to balance technology innovation with operational excellence.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
                Looking back at my time at Opendoor, I see it as a formative experience that shaped my perspective on how technology can transform traditional industries. The company taught me that true innovation often happens at the intersection of technology, operations, and business model design.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than anything, Opendoor showed me the power of building technology that empowers humans rather than simply replacing them. This human-computer partnership approach has informed my work ever since, helping me build products that leverage the strengths of both automation and human judgment.
            </p>
